Changing to see if it breaks

Commit-style practices
	Commits are the units of version control
	They should each "do" one thing -- not necessary for each individual change, but helpful for each "group" of changes
	Commit messages should indicate what done by commit
	Lots of small commitments lead to a steady relationship with your code
	"Think a little about what you're doing"

Git doesn't track creation/deletion of empty subdirectories, but it will track adding, deleting, and changing the files within them (it tracks files recursively)

A soft reset is recommended -- gets rid of commitsÂ but doesn't change files back
Hard reset -- what it sounds like-- that part of the version history is gone
