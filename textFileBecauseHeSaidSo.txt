Changing to see if it breaks

Commit-style practices
	Commits are the units of version control
	They should each "do" one thing -- not necessary for each individual change, but helpful for each "group" of changes
	Commit messages should indicate what done by commit
	Lots of small commitments lead to a steady relationship with your code
	"Think a little about what you're doing"
